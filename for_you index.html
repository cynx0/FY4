  hey, i made this website just for you in hopes that i could finally tell you everything that ive been meaning too.

 long time no speak , i thought i would make this for you so i could tell you how everything u have been deserving too hear.
i want you to know life has been good for me so far , ive really learnt to be happy and moved on from everything 
i still have bad and good days , but who doesnt , ive REALLY wanted to say SORRY for everything.
i put you throught too much and i didnt wish too , i hope your happy with life. 
i wanted to also let you know that im really proud of you , ive seen how hard you have ben working through ur grades and im happy for you 
im sorry for being so needy and pushy back then , i cannot stress how sorry i am for everything 
also im sorry for laughing when ur grandad died i lost mine too back in the summer and i cant imagine how u felt 
it mustve been horrible and i just laughed im so sorry really u deserve the world with how patient you were with me 
theres been so much good thats happened but i wont bore you with all of it , thank you for everything u have done for me 

but i just want to let you know how sorry i am , really i have changed and become better 
dont worry about the ignoring thing ill still keep that up if its want , i would be surprised if u even read all of this 
i wish u do well in ur exams and i hope you enjoy ur christmas and ur bday too cuz when i see you again itll be ur bday.
